This prototype Streamlit application consists of a blockchain-based ledger system that allows the conduction of financial transactions through a user-friendly web interface. More specifically, it allows the transfer of money between senders and receivers and verifies the validity of the data in the ledger.

## Technologies
The technologies required to use this project include: python 3.7 with pandas, dataclasses, typing, datetime, and hashlib. As well as streamlit.
